= Red Hat Data Grid Service

Red Hat Data Grid is an in-memory, distributed key/value store. This service provides a stable, persistent, and linearly scalable implementation of Data Grid for Red Hat OpenShift.

== Creating a Data Grid Service

Use this template to create a StatefulSet Pod that you can customize to your specific needs. Do the following:

. Add the template to the `openshift` namespace.
.. `$ oc login -u system:admin`
.. `$ oc create
-n openshift
-f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/jboss-datagrid-7-openshift-image/f91b94cfd7da4630ca188cd43c26755ecfc99bdd/services/datagrid-service.json`
. Instantiate the template.
.. `$ oc login -u developer`
.. `$ oc new-project mydatagrid`
.. `$ oc new-app datagrid-service -p APPLICATION_USER=username
+
The command output shows the resources that the template creates, as follows:
+
[source,bash,options=nowrap]

secret "datagrid-service" created
service "datagrid-service-headless" created
service "datagrid-service-ping" created
