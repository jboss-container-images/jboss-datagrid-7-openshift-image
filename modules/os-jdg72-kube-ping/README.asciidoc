What it is?
===========

JDG 7.2 is shipped with the https://github.com/jgroups-extras/jgroups-kubernetes[upstream version of KUBE_PING] we
need to change a few bits in order to make it work.

Why this has been implemented here and not in the modules repo?
===============================================================

Upstream KUBE_PING is a thing we would like to test early in development loop. Having said that, we need to be able to quickly
revert changes when needed. A perfect way to do it is to limit required actions to a single repo.

Ok, so what we need to do?
==========================

1. Change layer order in `layers.conf`
2. Alter configuration (replace `openshift` with `kubernetes` in xml files)
3. use new labels in a backwards-compatible way (we will probably deprecate old versions in 7.x timeline)
