^ Defines environment variables and labels used by S2I.  Modules implementing S2I capabilities should use these variables accordingly.

toc::[]

== Labels

The following labels will be defined on the image:

io.openshift.s2i.destination:: /tmp

io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url:: image:///usr/local/s2i

org.jboss.container.deployments-dir:: /deployments

== Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used to configure the functionality provided by this module:

|=======================================================================
|Name |Description |Example
|APP_DATADIR |Deprecated by **S2I_SOURCE_DATA_DIR**. |
|CUSTOM_INSTALL_DIRECTORIES |Deprecated by **S2I_IMAGE_SOURCE_MOUNTS**. |
|DATA_DIR |Deprecated by **S2I_TARGET_DATA_DIR**. |
|DEPLOYMENTS_DIR |Deprecated by **S2I_TARGET_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR**. |
|JAVA_DATA_DIR |Deprecated by **S2I_TARGET_DATA_DIR**. |
|S2I_ARTIFACTS_DIR |^ Location mount for artifacts persisted with **save-artifacts** script, which are used with incremental builds.  This should not be overridden by end users. |${S2I_DESTINATION_DIR}/artifacts}
|S2I_DESTINATION_DIR |^ Root directory for S2I mount, as specified by the **io.openshift.s2i.destination** label.  This should not be overridden by end users. |/tmp
|S2I_ENABLE_INCREMENTAL_BUILDS |^ Do not remove source and intermediate build files so they can be saved for use with future builds.  Defaults to true. |true
|S2I_IMAGE_SOURCE_MOUNTS |^ Comma separated list of relative paths in source directory which should be included in the image.  List may include wildcards, which are expanded using find.  By default, the contents of mounted directories are processed similarly to source folders, where the contents of $S2I_SOURCE_CONFIGURATION_DIR, $S2I_SOURCE_DATA_DIR, and $S2I_SOURCE_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR are copied to their respective target directories.  Alternatively, if an **install.sh** file is located in the root of the mount point, it is executed instead.  Deprecates CUSTOM_INSTALL_DIRECTORIES. |extras/*
|S2I_SOURCE_CONFIGURATION_DIR |^ Relative path to directory containing application configuration files to be copied over to the product configuration directory, see **S2I_TARGET_CONFIGURATION_DIR**.  Defaults to **configuration**. |configuration
|S2I_SOURCE_DATA_DIR |^ Relative path to directory containing application data files to be copied over to the product data directory, see **S2I_TARGET_DATA_DIR**.  Defaults to **data**. |data
|S2I_SOURCE_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR |^ Relative path to directory containing binary files to be copied over to the product deployment directory, see **S2I_TARGET_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR**.  Defaults to **deployments**. |deployments
|S2I_SOURCE_DEPLOYMENTS_FILTER |Space separated list of filters to be applied when copying deployments. Defaults to ** * **
 |*.jar *.war *.ear
|S2I_SOURCE_DIR |^ Location of mount for source code to be built.  This should not be overridden by end users. |${S2I_DESTINATION_DIR}/src}
|S2I_TARGET_CONFIGURATION_DIR |^ Absolute path to which files located in $S2I_SOURCE_DIR/$S2I_SOURCE_CONFIGURATION_DIR are copied. |/opt/eap/standalone/configuration
|S2I_TARGET_DATA_DIR |^ Absolute path to which files located in $S2I_SOURCE_DIR/$S2I_SOURCE_DATA_DIR are copied. |/opt/eap/standalone/data
|S2I_TARGET_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR |^ Absolute path to which files located in $S2I_SOURCE_DIR/$S2I_SOURCE_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR are copied. Additionally, this is the directory to which build output is copied |/deployments
